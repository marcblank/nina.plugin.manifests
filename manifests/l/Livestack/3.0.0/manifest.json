        "ShortDescription": "Live stacking within N.I.N.A.",
        "LongDescription": "This plugin enables live stacking functionality within N.I.N.A. - It allows you to view a live stack of your images, calibrate them, and manage them in real-time during your imaging session.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nBefore using this plugin, ensure you meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\n+ **PC Requirements**: Ensure your system has sufficient memory to handle live stacking.\r\n+ **Working Directory**: Set a folder for storing calibration files, temporary files, and live stack files.\r\n+ **Plugin Settings**: Adjust additional settings on the plugin page according to your preferences.\r\n+ **Master Calibration Files**: (Optional) Add Bias, Dark, or Flat master files for calibration.\r\n\r\n## Sequencer Instructions\r\n\r\n+ **Stack Flats**\r\n  This instruction works in conjunction with your Flat frame captures:\r\n  + Place this instruction within a set of Flat frame capture instructions, positioned after the last Flat frame capture.\r\n  + As Flat frames are captured, the instruction automatically gathers and calibrates them in the background.\r\n  + Once executed, the instruction will stack all the Flat frames that have been gathered and save the result.\r\n  + The stacked result is then automatically added to the session library within the live stack panel.\r\n\r\n+ **Start Live Stack**\r\n  Initiates the live stacking process within the **Imaging** tab.\r\n\r\n+ **Stop Live Stack**\r\n  Ends the live stacking process within the **Imaging** tab.\r\n\r\n## Live Stacking Panel\r\n### Expander Options\r\n\r\nThe **Live Stack** panel includes several useful features:\r\n\r\n+ **Session Flat Master Files**:\r\n  You can manually add individual session Flat master files. Alternatively, the *Stack Flats* instruction can automatically populate this list.\r\n\r\n+ **Multi-Session Flat Masters**:\r\n  These are not displayed in the panel but will be used if configured in the plugin settings page.\r\n\r\n+ **Quality Gates**:\r\n  You can apply quality gates to filter out frames that don't meet certain criteria for stacking.\r\n\r\n+ **Target Color Combination**:\r\n  For a given target, you can specify a color combination to create a color stack after the next frame of that target is processed.\r\n\r\n### Live Stacking Process\r\n\r\n+ **Start Live Stack**\r\n  Once started, the plugin will process and stack any light frames that are captured in real-time.\r\n\r\n  + All captured frames will be calibrated and added to a stack.\r\n  + Filters and target names are automatically recognized and managed. You can create separate stacks for different filters or targets.\r\n  + **Note**: One-shot color images (OSC) are automatically separated into individual channels (Red, Green, Blue) and also combined into a color stack.\r\n\r\n+ **Stacked Frame Count**\r\n  Within the stack window, you can view the current number of frames that have been stacked.",
